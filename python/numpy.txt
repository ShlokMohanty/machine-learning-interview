Numpy :
numerical python , is one of the most important foundational packages for numerical computing 
in python.
things that we may find interesting in numpy are :
1) ndarray , an efficient multidimensional array providing fast array-oriented arithmetic operations
and flexible broadcasting capabilities .

2) Mathematical functions for fast operations on entire array of data without having to write loops.
3)Tools for reading/writing array data to disk and working with the memory mapped files.
4) A C API for connecting Numpy with libraries written in c,c++, or fortran .

most imp areas for a data analyst to keep working on data using numpy :
1) data munguing and cleaning --> Fast vectorized array operations 
2) algorithms like sorting , unique, and set operations 
3) descriptive stats and aggregating /summarizing data 
4) relational data manipulations for merging and joining together heterogeneous datasets.
5) expressing conditional logic as array expressions instead of loops with if-elif-else branches 
6) Group-wise data manipulations 

specially on tabular most of the analysts will use ---> pandas for tabular data .
time series manipulation is not present in numpy .

without the need for python loops numpy makes the advantage of doing the computations .

multiplying each sequence by 2 :
my_arr = np.arange(1000000)
%time for _ in range(10): 
my_arr2 = my_arr * 2

cpu times : user 20 ms , sys: 50 ms , total = 70ms
wall time: 72.4 ms

%time for _ in range(10)
my list2 = [x * 2 for x in my_list]
cpu times : user 760 ms , sys: 290 ms, total: 1.05 s
wall time : 1.05 s
