Crime Prediction Techniques :
1) visualizing criminal network 
2) reducing risks 
3) increasing productivity of crime analysts

helps in predicting correct place of crime and criminal as well as aids in keeping track of resources pertaining 
to analysis of crime.
This can be done by a fitting data mining approach,machine learning algorithms and staticstical tools.
clustering in data mining :
1) K-Means clustering 
2) Density-based clustering 
3) coweb clustering and filtered clustering techniques 

ways to reduce the crime rates .
other ways :
1) Bayesian neural networks 
2) Levenberg Marquardt
3) scaled algorithm 

Crime analysis involves : 
1) extraction of crime patterns 
2) prediction and crime detection

visualizing techniques and a series of algorithms were used to find teh hidden human perceptions of crime in order
to help the law enforcement agencies for better crime prediction.

decision tree algorithms and k-means algorithm for developing a framework on criminal data analysis 

Naive Bayesian and Back Propagation algorithms and developed an improved approach of these classification 
algorihtms prediction of crime .

measures like accuracy and precision for comparing these algorithms.

Classification is a predictive technique which has been applied nominal labelling of classes and is used in crime analysis, weather forecasting.

used measures like accuracy and precision for comparing these algorithms. 
Used support vector machine and regression for controlling complexity by aaplying absolute value combination technique 
epsilon insensitive region of feature selection.

KNN usage for predicting crimes using data from National Crime Records Bureau

usage of supervised machine learning technique and performed crime rate analysis including data 
validation ,  Visualization ,cleaning of data and single, bi and multivariate analysis data modelling 
which involved predictive model of machine learning
