EDA is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics ,often 
employing data visualization methods.determines the best to manipulate data sources to get the answers that we need,
The main purpose of EDA is to help look at the data before making any assumptions .It can help identify obvious errors 
pattern understanding within the data , detect outliers or anomalous events .

tools for EDA:

clustering and dimension redution techniques ,helps create graphical displays of high-dimensional data containing 
many variables .

Univariate visualization of each field in a the raw dataset and summary statistics.

Bivariate visualizations and summary statistics that allow you to assess the relationship between each variable 
in the dataset and the target variable 

Multivariate visualizations for mapping and understanding interactions between different fields in teh data .

K-means clustering is a clustering method in unsupervised learning where data poits are assigned into k groups 
data points closest to a particular centroid will be clustered under the same category.

Predictive models,such as linear regression , use statistics and data to predict outcomes .
